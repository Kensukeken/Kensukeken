### Hi there!
Call me Ken/Akira. I'm an artist and I code in TeX, Python and C++. <br/>
TeX - Most good at it <br/>
Python - Still a beginner <br/>
C++ - Somewhat good at it <br/>
Feel free to contract me in Discord: `Kensukeken#2016`

## TeX
LaTeX Templates
This repository provides a collection of LaTeX templates for various document types, including articles, reports, presentations, and resumes. Each template includes a README.md file with instructions on how to use the template and customize it for your needs.

In addition to the templates, the repository includes a resources directory with sample images, bibliographies, and other files that may be useful in creating LaTeX documents.

To use a template, simply clone the repository and open the corresponding .tex file in your favorite LaTeX editor. The templates are designed to be easily customizable, so you can easily change fonts, colors, and other style elements to fit your needs.

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have a LaTeX template that you'd like to share, please submit a pull request with your template and a README.md file that provides instructions on how to use it.

## C++
Data Structures and Algorithms in C++
This repository provides an implementation of various data structures and algorithms in C++. The code is organized into separate directories for each data structure or algorithm, with each directory containing a README.md file that provides an overview of the implementation and its time and space complexity.

In addition to the code, the repository includes a test directory with unit tests for each implementation. The unit tests use the Google Test framework, and can be run using the make test command.

To use the code in this repository, simply clone the repository and compile the desired implementation using your favorite C++ compiler. The code is designed to be easy to use and integrate into your own projects.

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have an implementation of a data structure or algorithm that you'd like to share, please submit a pull request with your code and a README.md file that provides an overview of the implementation and its time and space complexity.

## Python
Python Machine Learning Examples
This repository provides a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate various machine learning techniques, including classification, regression, and clustering. Each script includes a README.md file that provides an overview of the technique being demonstrated and how to run the script.

In addition to the scripts, the repository includes a data directory with sample datasets that can be used to train and test the machine learning models. The datasets are in various formats, including CSV, JSON, and Excel.

To use the scripts in this repository, simply clone the repository and run the desired script using Python 3. The scripts require various Python packages, including scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy, which can be installed using pip.

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have a machine learning example that you'd like to share, please submit a pull request with your script and a README.md file that provides an overview of the technique being demonstrated and how to run the script.
