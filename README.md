### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My passion for Tex knows no bounds, and I'm always happy to lend my expertise to anyone who needs it. As for C#, Python and JavaScript, I'm still a beginner, but I'm determined to master these languages and create amazing applications. I'm also currently learning C++ at school and finding it to be a fascinating subject.
